Which editor I prefer: Emacs

Emacs
*Like*
Has a menu available, shares some commands with normal GUI commands, such as "Shift" + "< or >" to select an area. Inserting text also seems slightly easier on Emacs. Emacs also seems more forgiving than the others because I can still use my cursor to an extent, even if I still have to navigate via arrow keys. 

*Dislike*
I found the search function for all of the editors too difficult to use - I think it's because I never got the hang of grep, and couldn't scroll through search results the way I can on a GUI. 

Nano
*Like*
Feels old school and simple. Bottom navigation bar with basic commands did help a little bit, but still wouldn't have gotten through it without Becky's help prior to the assignment.

*Dislike*
Still too difficult to use and remember the commands easily. 

Vi
*Like*
Very short commands, such as the escape key, followed by ":" and "w" or "q" or "wq" together. Seems to be the most well documented online, so finding answers on how to use it was fairly easy. 


*Dislike*
Did not like how difficult it was to navigate, edit, text, and personally found the "w" command not intuitive at all. I just wanted to rename my file, and didn't find any Google results which answered my question easily. I used my creativity to try "w (insert filenmae here)" and it worked, thankfully, but I thought it was not intuitive to most users, and would have never figured it out on my own.

Overall this assignment was fairly difficult for me, and I'm very thankful for the GUI we have today. I know I might get better at this with practice, but overall, the structure of these editors has made me wonder about the history of the web, computer development, and the original creators of these products - I think many of them did not think of sustainable solutions (As we covered in WATS Quarter 1) and just wanted quick fixes.
It's inspired me to think of better solutions for people with accessibility needs or from other countries. However, it is pretty cool that we can make our own text documents all from the cmd, without ever opening another 'app,' so that is impressive in itself.
